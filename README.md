Description :
Template-based peptide design is a computational method used to design peptides with specific properties or functions. 
It involves using a known protein structure or a peptide template as a starting point to design a new peptide sequence that can perform a desired function or interact with a specific target.
Here is the variables used in the codes: 

 template_sequence : the fragment of the template protein which is bound to the target receptor and is set to inspire the peptide design. 
 p: the position of hotspot in template sequence which is mutated. the vector includes possible alteranative resiodues to which the template seuqnce is mutated. 
 all_combinations : a table of all combination as a table 


the output of the code is a fasta file containing all mutants indicated and numbered:
